#### I'm Justis. I'm a Software Engineer and a glass artist. Mainly work with JavaScript (React.JS, Node.JS), and Python. Bootcamp graduate, working through a Google Certification, IT Automation Specialist with Python. Having developed webapps and web pages, I have found that my interest lies in software architecture, devops, and reliability. So as I said, I'm attaining the certificate and working on small personal projects focusing on scalable infrastructure. Mainly using terraform to spin up AWS resources.
